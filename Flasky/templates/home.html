{# Working with Manual Escaping¶
If manual escaping is enabled, it’s your responsibility to escape variables if needed. What to escape? If you have a variable that may include any of the following chars (>, <, &, or ") you SHOULD escape it unless the variable contains well-formed and trusted HTML. Escaping works by piping the variable through the |e filter:

{{ user.username|e }}
    #}
